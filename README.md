Coding Quiz
===========

Super-simple tool for administering coding quizzes, and an excuse to
play around with the Flask/Postgres/SQLAlchemy stack on Heroku.

**Motivation:** I have had good experiences using a service like
Codility to administrate interview pre-screen coding problems, but I
wanted to be able to write my own tests and specifically *do not* want
auto-grading or a hard time limit -- I care about time-limits only
insofar as I don't want to give people *so* much time that they can
outsource their solution to StackOverflow...but if a candidate takes
2:05 instead of 2:00, who cares?
